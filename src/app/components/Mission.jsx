            At Inspire Alliance Fund Group Inc., our mission is to ignite change by empowering dreams. 
            We believe that real progress begins when individuals are given the resources, trust, and 
            opportunities to build a better future—not just for themselves, but for their communities 
            and beyond.
          </p>

            We are more than a funding platform; we are a movement that connects purpose-driven 
            people with the support they need to turn ideas into impact. By investing in human 
            potential, we cultivate a ripple effect—supporting lives, strengthening economies, 
            and shaping a future where hope and innovation thrive together.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Our commitment is clear: to inspire growth, fund possibilities, and fuel a collective 
            journey toward a more empowered world.
